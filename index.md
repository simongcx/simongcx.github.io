I am using this User repository to store my notes.

## Why I'm doing this
* I want to take notes as I learn things
* I want to be able to access those notes wherever I am
* my notes *might* be useful to other people, hence there is a *possible* benefit of them being public, set against minimal disadvantages of them being public (the only one I can think of is that people could get a bad impression of my education and skills from the quality/extent of my notes)

## Advantages of GitHub
* online file editing
* syntax highlighting
* change control
* local sync is useful if travelling with no Internet connection

## Features I'd like that aren't on GitHub
* Generated contents page with hyperlink to headings (although I could generate this myself)
* Numbered headings
