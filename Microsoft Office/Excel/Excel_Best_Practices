* Row order shouldn't matter
* Column order shouldn't matter (i.e. moving a column position should not break the spreadsheet)
* Consistent formulae all the way down a column
* No subtotals
* No blank rows
* No blank columns
* Use Tables
* Don't formula-link files
* It is better to reference something by name, than by cell reference / position
* It is better to have a single spreadsheet on a topic than one per month, or one per year

Basically, make it as much like a database as possible.
