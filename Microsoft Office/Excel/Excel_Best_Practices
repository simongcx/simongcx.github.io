* Row order shouldn't matter
* Column order shouldn't matter (i.e. moving a column position should not break the spreadsheet)
* Consistent formulae all the way down a column
* No subtotals
* No blank rows
* No columns
* Use Tables
* Don't formula-link files that aren't in the same folder

Basically, make it as much like a database as possible.
