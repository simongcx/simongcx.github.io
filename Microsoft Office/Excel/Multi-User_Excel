"If you apply the Protect method with the UserInterfaceOnly argument set to True to a worksheet and then save the workbook, the entire worksheet (not just the interface) will be fully protected when you reopen the workbook. To unprotect the worksheet but re-enable user interface protection after the workbook is opened, you must again apply the Protect method with UserInterfaceOnly set to True."

- Can lock/unlock cells on a protected sheet via VBA
- Can't protect/unprotect sheet (either via UI or VBA) on a shared workbook
