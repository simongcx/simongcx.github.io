# pycallgraph
To get pycallgraph to work I had to do a number of things:
* Install GraphViz (there are windows binaries)
* Install pycallgraph
* Install PyDot, dot_parser, and pyparsing (not sure if I really did need to install these, but one website suggested it)
* Restart windows (it might be that the Windows PATH is not updated to cmd on install?)
* Ensure that the filename of the output didn't have spaces
